# VIP-S Computer
The VIP-S (Simplified) is a reproduction of the J-VIP computer that was designed by Josh Bensadon and Walter Miraglia in 2015. It's original purpose was to provide a cheap way to experience real VIP hardware with some exclusions like the full expansion ports.

Like the J-VIP, it runs the VIP or the JVIP rom and takes advantage of the VIP firmware to load and save programs on tape or interface to a computer via the bit bang connectors at 9600 baud.

## <ins>Version 1.0b</ins> is the latest version with video improvements and a BD139 driven Q output to control relays or other circuits.
