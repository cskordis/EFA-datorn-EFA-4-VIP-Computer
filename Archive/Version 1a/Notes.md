# There was an issue with the video circuit making it a bit unstable. The following patch corrected the issue, but sunbsequent versions including 1.0b will be correct.

1. Cut trace between R25 200&Omega; and Q2 2N3904 Emitter
2. Add on the underside a 30&Omega; resistor from the 200&Omega; resistor to the emitter. 
This correction essentially replaces the direct link from R25 and the Q2 Emitter with the 30&Omega; resistor.
