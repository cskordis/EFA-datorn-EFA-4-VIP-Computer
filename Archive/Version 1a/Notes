## There was an issue with the video circuit making it a bit unstable. The following patch corected the issue but Version 1.0b has the corrected video changes.

1. Cut trace between R25 200 Ohm and Q2 2N3904 Emitter
2. Add on the underside a 30 Ohm resistor from the 200 Ohm resistor to the emitter.
This correction essentially replaces the direct link from R25 and the Emitter with the 30 Ohm resistor.
